# *Zoo Management System*

This is a Java project for managing animals in a zoo. The project uses inheritance to avoid code duplication between different types of animals.

The base class Animal defines common attributes for all animals, including a name and an age. The derived class Mammals adds an attribute for fur color, while the derived class Birds adds an attribute for wing span. The derived class Reptiles does not add any new attributes, but it can be expanded in the future if needed.

The project includes unit tests for each class to ensure correct behavior.

## *Getting Started*

To run the project, clone the repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE. Then, run the Main class.
